# Pull Request Approval Process

So! You have made your Pull Request and you are wondering why your code hasn't been added to the project yet! It is likely waiting on approval. This is how an administrator on the project can approve your code and add it to the original project.

## Approving and Merging the Pull Request

The user (and anyone else) can see all of the pending Pull Requests for the project on the `Pull requests` tab.

Here, there is one Pull Request waiting for approval. An administrator will select the Pull Request to review it.

The adminstrator will likely look at all three tabs - `Conversation`, `Commits`, and `Files changed` - to determine if the code meets the standards of the open source project.

If everything looks good. The administrator will click the `Merge pull request` button and add a quick confirmation message:

And the code is now a part of the original project!

> Note: This is what the process looks like if everything goes right. If the request is rejected or there is disagreement about whether a Pull Request should be included, this process can get a lot messier. This process also does not include actual "Approval" since changes are simply merged into the project. This process can definitely be elaborated upon in the future, but we're trying to keep things as approachable as possible without overcomplicating.
